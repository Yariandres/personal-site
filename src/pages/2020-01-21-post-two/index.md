    There are several metrics that can be used to measure market sentiment and general interest. Google searches are one and they are up for bitcoin by a big margin.
  </h3>

  <p class="paragraph">
  During the depths of crypto winter market sentiment and general interest wanes as bitcoin and crypto assets are put on the back burner for casual traders and the general public.

  Only when bitcoin starts surging again, and especially when it tops $10,000, do people start paying attention again.

  Taking a look at Google search trends can give us an indication as to how much interest there is from the general public and whether it could result in another round of FOMO.

    BITCOIN GOOGLE SEARCH SURGES
  </h3>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Google searches for bitcoin have surged by 33% over the past week which is picking up from a six month low.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Unsurprisingly the peaks in searches coincide with the two peaks in BTC price, the first in December 2017 and the second in June 2019. Since the beginning of this year searches have increased by around 37% globally.
  </p>



   <p class="paragraph">
    It does appear though that people start searching for bitcoin after the asset has peaked though not many can reliably predict where that top will be.

    What is more interesting, but again predictable, is that Google searches for ‘bitcoin halving’ has shown an even steeper rise as the event approaches.

      1. Using Google Trends to Find Niches
  </h3>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Google Trends is a great tool to find a skyrocketing niche. Whenever looking for a new niche, you’ll want to make sure you change your range from “Past 12 months” to “2004-present.” Doing this helps you see clearly whether the search volume is increasing or declining. But it also allows you to see seasonal trends in one clear-cut shot.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
     Here’s an example of a skyrocketing product in Google Trends: posture corrector.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
     You can see quite clearly that over the past several months there’s been skyrocketing growth. In January we saw a sudden peak with a slight dip in February. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t still capitalize on sales. So this trending product would need to be monitored for a while longer.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
     Here’s an example of a stable niche in Google Trends: men’s fashion.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
     You can clearly see in the graph that there are slight dips. However, for the most part, the search volume for this niche is pretty stable. Over the span of several years you’ll see some slight dips or increases, which is normal. But for the most part, Google Trends shows that men’s fashion is a pretty stable niche. You might be wondering what the dips and increases mean. Those show you the seasonal trends of the searches. October through December sees an increase in searches with a decline starting in January. That doesn’t mean you don’t want to start a men’s fashion store in January, it just means you might see a lower amount of website traffic at that time of year.
