      1. Using Google Trends to Find Niches
  </h3>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Google Trends is a great tool to find a skyrocketing niche. Whenever looking for a new niche, you’ll want to make sure you change your range from “Past 12 months” to “2004-present.” Doing this helps you see clearly whether the search volume is increasing or declining. But it also allows you to see seasonal trends in one clear-cut shot.

  <p class="paragraph">
     Here’s an example of a skyrocketing product in Google Trends: posture corrector.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
     You can see quite clearly that over the past several months there’s been skyrocketing growth. In January we saw a sudden peak with a slight dip in February. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t still capitalize on sales. So this trending product would need to be monitored for a while longer.

  <p class="paragraph">
     Here’s an example of a stable niche in Google Trends: men’s fashion.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
     You can clearly see in the graph that there are slight dips. However, for the most part, the search volume for this niche is pretty stable. Over the span of several years you’ll see some slight dips or increases, which is normal. But for the most part, Google Trends shows that men’s fashion is a pretty stable niche. You might be wondering what the dips and increases mean. Those show you the seasonal trends of the searches. October through December sees an increase in searches with a decline starting in January. That doesn’t mean you don’t want to start a men’s fashion store in January, it just means you might see a lower amount of website traffic at that time of year.
