  <h2 class="c margin-bottom-small margin-top-small">In 2019 there was three core algorithm updates. One in March, June and a final one in September.</h2>
    
    
  <h3 class=" margin-bottom-small margin-top-small">
    Do you know what was the result of these updates?
  </h3>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Probably not and I bet that 99% of people reading this article don’t either. It's not because these updates were not important, it’s because the updates did not affect the ground foundation for building SEO success. So instead of searching for the latest way to show your EAT (Expertise, Authority, and Trust) or trying to optimize for BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) you put 100% of your focus on the 3 most fundamentals that will determine the fate of your rankings.
  </p>  

   <h3 class=" margin-bottom-small margin-top-small">
      And that’s exactly what I will be covering on this article right now!
  </h3>

   <p class="paragraph">
    <strong>Google’s</strong> main line of business is the search algorithm, so it’s normal that it’s always changing. But one thing that has not changed is what the algorithm is trying to do. Google’s job is to provide the best result for any given query. It finds pages and ranks them to the best match for the user’s intents.
  </p>
  

   <h3 class=" margin-bottom-small margin-top-small">
      To filter and find the best result they use hundreds of different ranking factors
  </h3>

  <p class="paragraph">
    So, chasing algorithms is truly pointless instead your job as content creators, sales or digital marketers is to show search engines that your pages deserve to rank and the THREE things that will determine whether you rank or NOT are:
  </p>
  
  <p class="paragraph">1-	Content</p>
  <p class="paragraph">2-	Backlinks </p>
  <p class="paragraph">3-	Indexation</p>


  <h2 class="c margin-bottom-small margin-top-small">1-	Content:</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">
     First and arguably one of the most important things in SEO is content. No matter how good your writing skills are, it won’t rank unless you’ve gotten your content “PERFECTED”.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
     And by <strong>“PERFECTED” </strong>these are few major points to consider:
  </p>

   <h3 class=" margin-bottom-small margin-top-small">
      Search intent 
  </h3>

  <p class="paragraph">
     The reason behind the query. Search intent today is more important today than ever, you will want to match the type, angle of your top competitors pages – Introducing the three C’s!
  </p>

  <h3 class=" margin-bottom-small margin-top-small">
    Content type
  </h3>

  <p class="paragraph">Blog posts</p>
  <p class="paragraph">Product pages </p>
  <p class="paragraph">Category pages</p>
  <p class="paragraph">Landing pages</p>

  <h3 class=" margin-bottom-small margin-top-small">
     Content format
  </h3>

  <p class="paragraph">Blog posts</p>

  <li>"How to-s”</li>
  <li>Step by step tutorials</li>
  <li>List posts</li>
  <li>Opinion editorials</li>
   <br>
  <p class="paragraph">Landing pages</p>

  <li>Free tools</li>
  <li>Calculators</li>
  <li>List posts</li>
  <li>Giveaway </li>

  <h3 class=" margin-bottom-small margin-top-small">
     Content Angle
  </h3>

  <p class="paragraph">
     The hook! Why should people click onto your pages? Here is where you provide value to your audience, you connect with them.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
  <strong> - Cover the topic fully!</strong> 
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
     This does not mean that you have to discuss the last-minute detail of the topic. For example, if you are covering a topic about a face cream or a mobile phone. Just look at what the top pages are talking about and design your content accordingly.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
     Use a URL tool to check what keyword they are ranking for to see common terms rankings among the top 3 – 5 pages.
  </p>

   <p class="paragraph">
  <strong> -	Make sure that you get the basic ON-PAGE stuff down</strong> 
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">Things like: </p>
  <li>Title</li>
  <li>URL slugs</li>
  <li>List posts</li>
  <li>Heading tags </li>
   <br>
  <p class="paragraph">They are basic but important.</p>

  <p class="paragraph">
  <strong> -	Page load-time. How much time does your page takes to load? Use a tool to measure and push your developer to optimize:</strong> 
  </p>

  <ol>Images</ol>
  <ol>Icons</ol>
  <ol>Graphics</ol>
  <ol>Code</ol>

  <h3 class=" margin-bottom-small margin-top-small">
    2-	Backlinks
  </h3>

  <p class="paragraph">
     Continue focusing on building backlinks. Links have been and still are one of the strongest ranking signals. If you are in a competitive market, then you need to build them.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">Things like: </p>

  <li>broken link building</li>
  <li>The skyscraper technique </li>
  <li>Guest posting</li>
   <br>
  <p class="paragraph">They all work very well so keep them up.</p>

  <p class="paragraph">What does not work is copy other people’s work word by word and paste and sending the exact same email message everybody else is sending. This puts you in a box and does not yield the best results.</p>

  <p class="paragraph">Instead, try to put yourself in the shoes of the other person and give value to increase your chances of getting links.</p>

  <h3 class=" margin-bottom-small margin-top-small">
    3-	Indexation
  </h3>

  <p class="paragraph">Search engines are bot who crawl, parse and store the data in a database called search index. Then users are able to access the data via google search.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">So, if your pages are not indexed it is impossible to get your site in front of users eyes you could have exactly what they are looking for but they won’t know that you even exist if your page is not indexed.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">If you don’t have google search set up. Go to google.com and search for site:your-domain.com and you will see what google is indexing you for. If you don’t see anything there then that means you are not being indexed. If this is your case:</p>
  <p class="paragraph">Here are a few things you can do:</p>  

  <li>Make sure you have unintentionally no-indexed all your pages. Normally this happens when developers are migrating the site or there is a redesign. </li>
  <li>Go to you page source code and search for “noindex” if you find this bit of code then get your developers to remove it.</li>
  <li>Make sure you are not blocking Googlebot or user agents in your robots.txt</li>

  <p class="paragraph">Go to <strong>your-domain.com/robots.txt</strong> and if you see something like:</p>

  <p class="paragraph">User-agent : * <br>Disallow: /</p>

  <p class="paragraph">That mean you are blocking crawlers from navigating your site’s pages</p>
  <p class="paragraph">There's a tone of things you can do to fix page indexation but this are the basics and foundation you should know about.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">In conclusion, you don’t need to be an SEO master to rank your site, you just need to master these 3 fundamental things and most important of all. You need to get out there and start to competing with other. Focus on the things that matter the most rather chasing hacks from headlines claiming that SEO has changed.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">I would love to hear what your thoughts, so get intouch!</p>
  <p class="paragraph">Thanks, Yari</p>
